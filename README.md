# N-AryTreeJava
This project implements an n-ary tree structure using two main classes: NodoMArio and AlberoMArio. Each internal node stores a single piece of information of type String, and the tree is constructed based on the specified arity n (the number of children each node can have).
The project is designed to handle common n-ary tree operations and includes methods for managing, traversing, and manipulating the treeâ€™s structure efficiently.
